# Web Search Functionality Fix

## Issue

The web search functionality in the RAI Chat application was not working properly. When users asked questions that required web search (e.g., "who is Dan Martell?"), the system responded with:

```
Web search is currently unavailable.
```

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the codebase, two issues were identified:

1. **Incorrect Import Path in `action_handler.py`**:
   - The `action_handler.py` file was trying to import the `perform_search` function from an incorrect path:
     ```python
     from RAI_Chat.Built_in_modules.web_search_module.tavily_client import perform_search
     ```
   - The correct path should include the `Backend` directory:
     ```python
     from RAI_Chat.Backend.Built_in_modules.web_search_module.tavily_client import perform_search
     ```
   - Due to this incorrect import path, the import was failing, and the system was falling back to a dummy function that always returned "Web search is currently unavailable."

2. **Incorrect Import in `tavily_client.py`**:
   - The `tavily_client.py` file was importing `AppConfig` from an incorrect path:
     ```python
     from config import AppConfig
     ```
   - The correct path should be:
     ```python
     from RAI_Chat.Backend.config import AppConfig
     ```
   - This would have caused issues when trying to access the Tavily API key from the configuration.

## Solution

1. **Fixed Import Path in `action_handler.py`**:
   - Updated the import statement to use the correct path:
     ```python
     from RAI_Chat.Backend.Built_in_modules.web_search_module.tavily_client import perform_search
     ```

2. **Fixed Import in `tavily_client.py`**:
   - Updated the import statement to use the correct path:
     ```python
     from RAI_Chat.Backend.config import AppConfig
     ```

## Verification

After making these changes and restarting the RAI API server, the web search functionality is now working properly. Users can now ask questions like "who is Dan Martell?" and receive search results from the Tavily API.

## Additional Notes

- The Tavily API key is correctly configured in the `.env` file in the `RAI_Chat/Backend` directory.
- The web search functionality uses the Tavily API to perform searches and return formatted results.
- The system is designed to automatically trigger web searches when users ask questions that require current information or specific facts that might be outside the model's training data.
