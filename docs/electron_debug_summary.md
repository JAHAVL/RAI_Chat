# Electron Blank UI Debugging Summary (2025-04-04)

## Initial Problem

User reported a blank UI issue affecting all Electron development applications system-wide. This occurred even with newly created test apps and previously working backups. The goal is to diagnose and fix the rendering issue in the main `RAI_Chat/frontend` application.

## Troubleshooting Steps & Findings (Part 1 - UI Rendering)

1.  **Hypothesis: Electron/System Configuration Issue**
    *   **Action:** Modified `webpack.config.js` `publicPath` to `./`.
    *   **Action:** Modified `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/electron.js` to enable `nodeIntegration` and disable `contextIsolation` (for dev). Added load error logging.
    *   **Action:** Modified `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/preload.js` to work without context isolation.
    *   **Action:** Created minimal `test.html` and `test-electron.js` to isolate Electron rendering.
    *   **Finding:** The minimal Electron test app (`npm run test:electron`) worked correctly. This ruled out a fundamental Electron or system-wide rendering problem.

2.  **Hypothesis: React App Build/Rendering Issue**
    *   **Action:** Modified `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/electron.js` to load `test.html` directly, bypassing the React app bundle.
    *   **Finding:** The main app window successfully displayed `test.html`. Confirmed Electron configuration was likely okay, pointing towards an issue within the React application or its build process.
    *   **Action:** Created a minimal React test app (`SimpleApp.tsx`, `SimpleIndex.tsx`, `simple.html`).
    *   **Action:** Temporarily changed `webpack.config.js` entry point to `SimpleIndex.tsx`.
    *   **Action:** Modified `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/electron.js` to load `simple.html`.
    *   **Action:** Built the simple React app (`npm run build`).
    *   **Finding:** The simple React test app rendered correctly when loaded via Electron. Confirmed webpack and basic React setup were functional. Issue likely within the main application's specific code/components.

3.  **Hypothesis: Theme/Styling Errors in Main App**
    *   **Action:** Restored `webpack.config.js` and `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/electron.js` to load the main application bundle.
    *   **Finding:** Blank screen with `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'spacing')` originating from styled-components (`ChatMessageComponent.tsx`). Indicated a missing theme context.
    *   **Action:** Added `<ThemeProvider>` wrapper in `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/App.tsx`.
    *   **Action:** Updated `ChatMessageComponent.tsx`, `SystemMessageComponent.tsx`, and `ChatPage.tsx` to correctly consume the theme via `props.theme` instead of direct import.
    *   **Finding:** After fixing theme errors, the app unexpectedly started showing one of the previous test UIs again.

4.  **Hypothesis: Residual Test Files/Configuration Interference**
    *   **Action:** Removed test files: `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/test.html`, `RAI_Chat/frontend/public/simple.html`.
    *   **Finding:** Still showing test UI.
    *   **Action:** Identified and removed `test-electron.js` script from `package.json` and deleted the `RAI_Chat/frontend/test-electron.js` file.
    *   **Finding:** Still showing test UI.
    *   **Action:** Removed test React components: `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/SimpleApp.tsx`, `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/SimpleIndex.tsx`. Rebuilt app.
    *   **Finding:** Still showing test UI.
    *   **Action:** Created ultra-simple `test-simple.html` (no JS) and `test-simple.js` (basic Electron loader) to re-verify basic loading.
    *   **Finding:** `npm run test:simple` worked, confirming basic Electron loading.
    *   **Action:** Modified `RAI_Chat/frontend/main.js` (identified as the likely entry point used by `npm run dev`) to load `test-simple.html`.
    *   **Finding:** App displayed "Test Auth Page". This confirmed `main.js` is the active entry point and the React app *is* now loading, but landing on a simplified Auth page.

## Troubleshooting Steps & Findings (Part 2 - Login & Backend)

5.  **Hypothesis: Incorrect Frontend Code/Configuration**
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/pages/Login_Page/AuthPage.tsx`. Found comments indicating it might be a simplified version and an incorrect theme import path (`../../App` instead of `../../components/AppLayout`).
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/frontend/main.js`. Confirmed presence of code loading `test-simple.html`.
    *   **Action:** Removed the code block loading `test-simple.html` from `RAI_Chat/frontend/main.js`.
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/components/AppLayout.tsx`. Confirmed theme definition and export.
    *   **Action:** Corrected the theme import path in `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/pages/Login_Page/AuthPage.tsx` to `../../components/AppLayout` and removed debugging comments.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run build` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run dev` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Finding:** App still displayed "Test Auth Page". Search revealed the text existed in the compiled `build/bundle.js`.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run build` again in `RAI_Chat/frontend` to ensure changes were compiled.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run dev` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Finding:** App UI rendered correctly, but login failed. User suspected backend issue.

6.  **Hypothesis: Frontend/Backend Communication Mismatch**
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx`. Found login logic expected `response.token`.
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/api/rai_api.ts`. Found API client login method returned `response.access_token`.
    *   **Action:** Corrected `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/context/AuthContext.tsx` to expect `response.access_token`.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run build` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run dev` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Finding:** Login still failed. Console showed `ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` to `http://localhost:6102/api/auth/login`.

7.  **Hypothesis: Backend Not Running or Incorrect Port**
    *   **Action:** Attempted to run `RAI_Chat/Backend/start_all.py`.
    *   **Finding:** Failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'RAI_Chat'`.
    *   **Action:** Attempted to run `RAI_Chat/Backend/rai_api_server.py` directly.
    *   **Finding:** Server started successfully (process found).
    *   **Action:** Checked listening ports using `lsof -i :6102` (frontend target port).
    *   **Finding:** No process listening on 6102.
    *   **Action:** Checked listening ports using `netstat -an | grep LISTEN`.
    *   **Finding:** Found process listening on port 5002.
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/Backend/rai_api_server.py`. Confirmed it defaults to port 5002.
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/api/rai_api.ts`. Confirmed `API_BASE_URL` was set to `http://localhost:6102/api`.
    *   **Action:** Corrected `API_BASE_URL` in `RAI_Chat/frontend/src/api/rai_api.ts` to use port 5002.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run build` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Action:** Ran `npm run dev` in `RAI_Chat/frontend`.
    *   **Finding:** Login failed with 401 Unauthorized. Backend console showed `sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: users`.

8.  **Hypothesis: Database Configuration/Schema Issue**
    *   **Finding:** User confirmed a switch from SQLite to MySQL. Backend error indicates it's still trying to query a SQLite `users` table which doesn't exist. The `.env` file contains a MySQL connection string.
    *   **Action:** Searched for database configuration files. Found `.env` and `alembic.ini`.
    *   **Action:** Attempted to read `RAI_Chat/Backend/auth_db.py` to check DB connection logic.
    *   **Finding:** File not found error. *Task interrupted.*

## Current Status (as of 2025-04-04 1:48 PM)

*   The Electron UI rendering issues are resolved. The frontend application loads and displays the correct UI.
*   Frontend/Backend communication issues (token property name, API port) have been fixed.
*   The backend API server (`rai_api_server.py`) is running.
*   The frontend application (`npm run dev`) is running.
*   Login fails with a 401 Unauthorized error because the backend encounters a database error (`sqlite3.OperationalError: no such table: users`), indicating a mismatch between the expected database schema (likely SQLite) and the configured database (MySQL via `.env`).

## Database Configuration Fix (2025-04-04 2:05 PM)

The database configuration issue has been resolved. Here's what was done:

1. **Database Migration**:
   * Ran Alembic migrations to create the necessary tables in MySQL using `alembic upgrade head`
   * This created the `users` and `sessions` tables according to the schema defined in `RAI_Chat/Backend/core/database/models.py`

2. **SQLAlchemy Session Handling Fixes**:
   * Fixed a critical issue in `rai_api_server.py` where user attributes were being accessed after the database session was closed
   * Modified the registration endpoint to access user attributes while the session was still open
   * Fixed the login endpoint to store user details before the session closed
   * These changes resolved the `DetachedInstanceError` that was occurring

3. **API Response Format**:
   * Updated the login endpoint to return the token as `access_token` instead of `token` to match what the frontend was expecting

## Current Status (as of 2025-04-04 2:05 PM)

* The login system is now working correctly - users can register and log in
* The database is properly configured and connected to MySQL
* Some UI elements are still missing (chat library button, logout button)
* Chat functionality shows "Error: Failed to communicate with backend" when trying to send messages

## Problem Summary

In simple terms, the issue was a mismatch between the database configuration and the actual database setup:

1. The system was configured to use MySQL (via the `.env` file), but the necessary tables hadn't been created in the MySQL database
2. When trying to access the database, the system was falling back to SQLite (which didn't have the tables either)
3. Additionally, there were issues with how database sessions were being handled, causing errors when trying to access user data
4. Finally, there was a mismatch between what the backend was sending (`token`) and what the frontend was expecting (`access_token`)

The solution involved running the database migrations to create the tables in MySQL, fixing the session handling code, and ensuring the API response format matched what the frontend expected.

## Next Steps

1. Investigate the chat functionality issues - why messages aren't being sent to the backend
2. Look into the missing UI elements (chat library button, logout button)
3. Complete any remaining frontend-backend integration issues
