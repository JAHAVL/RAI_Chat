# Frontend Troubleshooting Summary (April 5, 2025)

This document summarizes the troubleshooting steps taken to address issues reported in the Electron frontend application, primarily concerning chat list loading and message response handling.

## Initial Reported Issues

1.  **"Searching..." Message:** A system message indicating "Searching..." during web searches needed to be implemented or made more visible.
2.  **"Error: Failed to get response":** An error occurred when sending chat messages, preventing the assistant's response from appearing after the "Thinking..." indicator.
3.  **Chat Library Loading Failure (401 Error):** The list of previous chat sessions failed to load, often accompanied by a 401 Unauthorized error, suggesting authentication problems.

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken

1.  **Backend Verification:**
    *   Confirmed LLM API Server (`:6301`) health and responsiveness via direct `curl` tests.
    *   Confirmed RAI API Server (`:6102`) health via direct `curl` tests.
    *   Tested user registration and login endpoints (`/api/auth/...`) via `curl`, confirming they work.
    *   Tested the authenticated chat endpoint (`/api/chat`) via `curl` with a valid token, confirming successful streaming response, including the `{"status": "searching", ...}` chunk during web searches.
    *   **Conclusion:** Backend components (LLM API, RAI API, ConversationManager, Auth) appear functional when accessed directly.

2.  **"Searching..." Message Enhancement:**
    *   Verified backend (`ActionHandler`) correctly yields the `searching` status update.
    *   Verified backend (`rai_api_server`) correctly streams this status update.
    *   Verified frontend (`ChatPage.tsx`) logic to add/remove the system message based on the status chunk.
    *   Enhanced styling of `SystemMessageComponent.tsx` for better visibility.

3.  **Chat Response Handling ("Failed to get response"):**
    *   Analyzed stream handling in `main.js` (`callBackend` function) - confirmed correct parsing of newline-delimited JSON and forwarding via `onChunk` callback.
    *   Analyzed IPC setup in `preload.js` (`onChatResponseChunk`) - confirmed correct listener setup and callback invocation.
    *   Analyzed state updates in `ChatPage.tsx` and `App.tsx` reducer.
    *   Identified potential stale closure issue with `currentMessages` when removing the loading indicator in `ChatPage.tsx`.
    *   Refactored `App.tsx` reducer to add `REMOVE_LOADING_INDICATOR` action.
    *   Updated `ChatPage.tsx` to dispatch `REMOVE_LOADING_INDICATOR` instead of searching for the specific loading message ID.

4.  **Chat Library Loading (401 Error) & Auth Refactor:**
    *   Confirmed `/api/sessions` endpoint requires authentication.
    *   Traced token passing via IPC: `AuthContext` -> `preload.js` -> `main.js` -> `callBackend`.
    *   Hypothesized token might be missing/stale during `fetchUserSessions` call from `AuthContext`.
    *   **Refactored Authentication:** Centralized token storage in `main.js`.
        *   Added `set-auth-token` and `clear-auth-token` IPC handlers in `main.js`.
        *   Modified `main.js` (`callBackend`, IPC handlers) to use the internally stored token.
        *   Modified `preload.js` to add `setAuthToken`/`clearAuthToken` and remove token params from other API functions.
        *   Modified `AuthContext.tsx` to call `setAuthToken`/`clearAuthToken` and remove token passing in `fetchUserSessions`.
        *   Modified `ChatPage.tsx` to remove token passing for `sendChatMessage`.
        *   Updated TypeScript definitions (`electron.d.ts`).

5.  **Electron Configuration & Startup:**
    *   Corrected `main` entry in `package.json` from `public/electron.js` to `main.js`.
    *   Corrected fallback file path in `main.js` to load `build/index.html` instead of `index.html`.
    *   Tested different `webPreferences` (`contextIsolation`, `nodeIntegration`, `enableRemoteModule`). Reverted to `nodeIntegration: true`, `contextIsolation: false` as other settings prevented UI load.
    *   Verified `preload.js` path and file existence.
    *   Added `toggleDevTools` menu item in `main.js`.

6.  **Logging & Diagnostics:**
    *   Added detailed file logging (`frontend_ipc_trace.log`) via IPC to trace communication between renderer and main processes.
    *   Added console logging to `preload.js` to verify its execution.
    *   Checked frontend stdout/stderr logs (`frontend_app.log`, `frontend_app_stderr.log`).

## Current Main Issue

Despite extensive troubleshooting and refactoring, the core problem persists: **The Electron preload script (`RAI_Chat/frontend/electron_app/preload.js`) is not executing.**

*   This is confirmed by the absence of *any* logs (console or file-based) originating from `preload.js` itself, even when logs are placed at the very beginning of the script.
*   Because the preload script doesn't run, the `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` call never happens.
*   Consequently, the `window.api` object is undefined in the renderer process (React application).
*   All attempts by the React application to use IPC (e.g., `window.api.logTrace`, `window.api.getChatSessions`, `window.api.sendChatMessage`) fail silently, preventing login validation, chat loading, message sending, and even diagnostic logging from the renderer.

## Remaining Unknowns / Next Steps

The root cause for the preload script failing to execute remains unclear, given that the path is correct, the file exists, and various `webPreferences` have been tried. Possible causes include:

1.  An Electron version-specific bug (`v28.0.0`).
2.  A subtle issue in the webpack build output (`build/index.html` or `build/bundle.js`) preventing preload attachment.
3.  An external system configuration or interference issue.
4.  An extremely early, uncaught error in the main process *after* window creation but before preload execution (less likely).

Further diagnosis requires steps that cannot be performed remotely:

1.  **Careful Renderer Console Check:** Manually checking the Electron Developer Console immediately upon window creation for any errors.
2.  **Manual Electron Execution:** Running `electron .` directly in the `RAI_Chat/frontend` directory to observe terminal output.
3.  **Trying a Different Electron Version:** Updating/downgrading Electron via `package.json` and `npm install`.
