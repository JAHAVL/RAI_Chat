What frameworks or libraries are you working with?\n2. **Application Type:** Are you building a website, a mobile app (iOS, Android, etc.), a desktop application, or something else?\n3. **Search Type:** Do you need a simple integration with an existing search engine (like Google Custom Search), or are you building a custom search engine from scratch?\n4. **Data Source:** Where will the search index come from?  A database, an API, or something else?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide much more specific and helpful guidance.  For example, if you're building a website and want to use Google Custom Search, I can walk you through the steps to integrate it.  If you are building a custom search engine, I can offer advice on indexing, searching algorithms, and other relevant aspects."
