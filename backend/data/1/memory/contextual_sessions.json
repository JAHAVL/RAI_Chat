              "tier1": "UDP is a connectionless, unreliable transport layer protocol that prioritizes speed over guaranteed delivery.",
              "tier2": "Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't establish a connection before sending data.  It sends datagrams individually, without tracking their order or confirming their receipt. This makes it faster but means packets can be lost or arrive out of order.  It's commonly used for applications where speed is crucial and some data loss is acceptable.",
              "tier3": "The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless, unreliable transport layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite.  Unlike TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), which provides reliable, ordered delivery of data, UDP prioritizes speed and low latency over guaranteed delivery. This makes it suitable for applications where speed is crucial even if some data loss is acceptable.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how UDP works:\n\n1. **Connectionless Communication:** UDP doesn't require a prior connection handshake.  A sender can send a datagram to a receiver without establishing a connection first. This significantly reduces overhead and latency.\n\n2. **Datagram Transmission:** Data is sent in units called datagrams. Each datagram is independent and contains the destination IP address and port number.  This allows multiple datagrams to be sent simultaneously without the need for ordering or sequencing.\n\n3. **Unreliable Delivery:** UDP doesn't guarantee delivery or order. Datagrams can be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of sequence. The receiver doesn't acknowledge the receipt of datagrams, and there's no mechanism for retransmission of lost packets.  This is a trade-off for speed.\n\n4. **Header Information:** Each UDP datagram has a header containing source and destination port numbers, datagram length, and a checksum for error detection. The checksum helps detect corrupted datagrams, but it doesn't guarantee error-free transmission.\n\n5. **Port Numbers:**  Port numbers are used to identify applications running on both the sending and receiving machines. This allows multiple applications on the same machine to use UDP simultaneously.\n\n6. **Applications of UDP:** UDP's speed and low overhead make it suitable for applications like:\n\n*   **Streaming media (video, audio):**  Some data loss is acceptable in streaming, and speed is prioritized.\n*   **Online games:**  Low latency is crucial for responsive gameplay, even if some packets are lost.\n*   **DNS (Domain Name System):**  While DNS often uses TCP, UDP is also used for its speed in query resolution.\n*   **VOIP (Voice over IP):**  Real-time communication prioritizes low latency over error-free transmission.\n\n**Comparison with TCP:**\n\n| Feature        | UDP                               | TCP                                 |\n|----------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| Connection     | Connectionless                     | Connection-oriented                  |\n| Reliability    | Unreliable                           | Reliable                             |\n| Ordering       | Unordered                           | Ordered                              |\n| Overhead       | Low                                 | High                                 |\n| Speed          | Fast                                | Slower                              |\n| Error Detection | Checksum (optional)                 | Full error detection and correction |\n| Congestion Control | None                                | Congestion control mechanisms exist |\n\nIn summary, UDP is a lightweight protocol ideal for applications that prioritize speed and low latency over reliable, ordered data delivery.  The choice between UDP and TCP depends on the specific requirements of the application."

For instance, we might combine the 'How It Works' and 'Gold Valuation' pages into a single, comprehensive page.\n*   **Simplified Design:**  While maintaining a professional and trustworthy aesthetic is crucial, we may need to opt for a slightly simpler design that reduces development time and costs.  We could explore using pre-built templates or focusing on a minimalist design.\n*   **Prioritized Features:**  We can prioritize the most essential features, such as the homepage, 'Sell Your Gold' page, and 'About Us' page.  Other features like the FAQ page or testimonials section could be added later if the budget allows.\n*   **Outsourced Development:**  If necessary, we might consider outsourcing some aspects of the development process (e.g., design or coding) to reduce costs.  This would require careful selection of a reliable and skilled developer.\n\nPlease let me know your priorities so I can create a tailored $2000 proposal.
